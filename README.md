This is a [giter8](http://github.com/n8han/giter8) template for Lift projects. 

## Using it

If you have giter8 installed simply run: 

    g8 git://github.com/mads379/lift-blank.g8.git

And you're up and running in no time!

## Working on the template

Giter8 version 0.5 supports running templates locally like this: 

    g8 file:///Users/mads379/dev/projects/open-source/lift.g8/

Using your own path to this project of course. Not that it uses git so 
you will have to commit you changes before it applies them.
